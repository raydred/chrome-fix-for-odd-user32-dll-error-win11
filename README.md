# chrome-fix-for-odd-user32-dll-error-win11
My powershell script solution for a weird error that prevented chrome to run on windows 11. (probably 10 as well)

**Let me explain...**

##The problem
I recognize that Windows (11,10) is a very complex system. With that said, **IT SUCKS! WINDOWS TOTALLY SUCK!** Now that I got that out of the way, I'll continue to the issue at hand...

For some reason, a month or 2 after I upgraded to Windows 11, my Chrome stopped working. It was bizarre, it's still bizarre. I can't remember when it stopped, but MONTHS ago, it stopped working. I switched to firefox until the same thing happened. At that point, I needed my Chrome browser back. I did the following :

- Googled solutions
- Tried a bunch of solutions
- uninstalled a hyberbolic amount of times
- reinstalled a hyberbolic amount of times
- Event log research
- Tried a bunch more solutions
- uninstalled a hyberbolic amount of times, again
- reinstalled a hyberbolic amount of times, again
- gave up
- got back in!
- decided to fix it.
